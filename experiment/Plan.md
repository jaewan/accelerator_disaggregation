# Improved Evaluation Plan: Demonstrating the Benefits of Framework-Level Semantic Awareness

## Objective
Clearly quantify the performance and network overhead benefits of framework-level semantic awareness (\sys) compared to realistic semantic-blind baselines.

## Evaluation Modes
We will evaluate four modes:

### 1. Local (Baseline)
- Model runs directly on GPU host. No network overhead.

### 2. Semantic-Blind (Naive Remote Execution)
- Simulates a system with no semantic knowledge or caching.
- **Implementation:** Every inference step (prefill and decode) transfers the entire model weights, input tokens, and all intermediate tensors (KV caches) to and from the remote GPU. No persistent caching or optimization is allowed.

### 3. Semantic-Blind + Remote Caching (Heuristic Optimization)
- Simulates a system that caches model weights remotely but has no semantic knowledge of data usage.
- **Implementation:** Model weights are sent and cached on the remote GPU once at startup. For prefill, only input tokens are sent. For each decode step, the new token and the full KV cache are sent to the remote, and logits and updated KV cache are returned. No semantic-aware optimizations (e.g., cache IDs, selective transfer) are used.

### 4. Framework-Level Semantic-Aware (\sys)
- Your current implementation, leveraging semantic awareness to distinguish persistent data (weights, KV caches) from transient data (tokens, activations).
- **Implementation:** Model weights are cached remotely once at startup. Prefill sends input tokens and receives logits and a KV cache reference ID. Each decode step sends only the new token and KV cache reference ID, receiving logits and an updated reference ID. This minimizes data transfer by exploiting semantic knowledge.

## Implementation Details for Baselines

### Semantic-Blind (Naive Remote Execution)
- **Initialization:** No persistent caching. Every inference step transfers the entire model weights and all intermediate tensors.
- **Prefill:** Transfer model weights and input tokens to GPU. Return logits and KV cache back to client.
- **Decode:** For each decode step, transfer model weights, KV cache, and new token to GPU. Return logits and updated KV cache back to client.

### Semantic-Blind + Remote Caching (Heuristic Optimization)
- **Initialization:** Cache model weights remotely once at startup.
- **Prefill:** Transfer input tokens to GPU. Return logits and KV cache back to client.
- **Decode:** For each decode step, transfer the new token and full KV cache to GPU. Return logits and updated KV cache back to client.

### Framework-Level Semantic-Aware (\sys)
- **Initialization:** Cache model weights remotely once at startup.
- **Prefill:** Transfer input tokens to GPU. Return logits and KV cache reference ID back to client.
- **Decode:** For each decode step, transfer only the new token and KV cache reference ID. Return logits and updated KV cache reference ID back to client.

## Metrics
- **End-to-End Latency (seconds):** Measure inference latency for prefill and decode phases.
- **Network Traffic (GB):** Measure total bytes transferred over the network.
- **GPU Utilization (%):** Measure GPU utilization to show efficiency.
- **Performance Variability (standard deviation):** Measure latency variability across multiple runs.

## Experimental Procedure

### Step 1: Setup
- Use your existing PyTorch RPC setup (already implemented).
- Run experiments on a single-node setup (as you currently have), clearly stating this limitation.

### Step 2: Run Experiments
- **Model:** GPT-J 6B (as currently used).
- **Prompt:** Fixed prompt length (e.g., 128 tokens).
- **Decode Steps:** 5 tokens (as currently used).
- **Repeat:** Run each mode 3 times to ensure statistical significance.

### Step 3: Data Collection
- Measure latency using Python's `time.time()` or `time`.
- Measure network traffic using your existing `_measure_tensor_bytes` function or `tcpdump` captures.
- Measure GPU utilization using `nvidia-smi dmon`.

### Step 4: Results Table
Present results clearly in a table:

| Phase   | Mode                          | Latency (s) | Network (GB) | GPU Util (%) | Latency Std Dev (s) |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Prefill | Local (Baseline)              | X ± Y       | 0            | X%           | Y                   |
| Prefill | Semantic-Blind (Naive)        | X ± Y       | X            | X%           | Y                   |
| Prefill | Semantic-Blind + Remote Cache | X ± Y       | X            | X%           | Y                   |
| Prefill | Framework-Level (\sys)        | X ± Y       | X            | X%           | Y                   |
| Decode  | Local (Baseline)              | X ± Y       | 0            | X%           | Y                   |
| Decode  | Semantic-Blind (Naive)        | X ± Y       | X            | X%           | Y                   |
| Decode  | Semantic-Blind + Remote Cache | X ± Y       | X            | X%           | Y                   |
| Decode  | Framework-Level (\sys)        | X ± Y       | X            | X%           | Y                   |

## Expected Outcomes
- **Semantic-Blind (Naive):** Highest network overhead and latency due to repeated transfers of weights and intermediate tensors.
- **Semantic-Blind + Remote Caching:** Moderate overhead, caching weights but still transferring large KV caches repeatedly.
- **Framework-Level (\sys):** Lowest overhead, transferring minimal data due to semantic awareness.

## Justification of Simulation Approach
Since you only have access to PyTorch-level instructions, simulating lower-level and caching baselines involves intentionally restricting semantic information:

- **Semantic-Blind (Naive):** Treat every inference step as requiring all data to be transferred, with no persistent caching or optimization.
- **Semantic-Blind + Remote Caching:** Cache weights but treat all intermediate tensors as opaque, forcing repeated transfers of KV caches and activations.

This approach provides a realistic approximation of the semantic blindness inherent in lower-level interception solutions, clearly demonstrating the benefits of your semantic-aware approach.

## Summary of Improvements Over Previous Evaluation
- Adds realistic baselines (semantic-blind naive and remote caching) to clearly demonstrate the benefits of semantic awareness.
- Clearly quantifies network overhead, latency, GPU utilization, and variability.
- Provides a strong, convincing evaluation aligned with your paper's claims, significantly strengthening your workshop submission.

### Appendix
Limitations and Justifications: Our current evaluation simulates semantic-blind and caching baselines at the PyTorch level, intentionally restricting semantic information to approximate semantic-blindness realistically. We acknowledge that real PCIe-level and driver-level solutions may implement optimizations beyond our simplified simulations. However, our simulations represent conservative, worst-case scenarios that clearly illustrate the fundamental benefits of semantic awareness. Additionally, our evaluation is currently limited to single-node experiments due to resource constraints. Future work will extend our evaluation to realistic multi-node setups and diverse workloads to further validate the generality and scalability of our semantic-aware approach
